# Set

This repository contains a Java implementation of the popular card game Set. The game is designed to run using the Processing framework, providing an interactive and visually appealing user interface.

## How to Play
Set is a card game where the objective is to identify sets of three cards that satisfy a specific set of rules. Each card has four features: shape, color, number, and shading. A set consists of three cards in which each feature is either all the same or all different across the three cards.

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Launch the application using Processing.
2. The game board will be displayed, consisting of a grid of cards.
3. Examine the cards on the board and look for sets of three cards that meet the criteria for a valid set.
4. When you identify a set, click on the three cards to select them.
5. If the selected cards form a valid set, they will be removed from the board, and you will earn points.
6. If the selected cards do not form a valid set, a message will be displayed indicating that it is not a set, and you will lose points.
7. If you are stuck, simply click "Find Set", but points will be deducted as a result.
8. The game will automatically generate new cards to replace the ones removed.
9. Continue finding sets and earning points until there are no more valid sets on the board.
10. The game will end, and your final score will be displayed.
